ðŸ©º Dr. Alex: hey Mr John how are you
ðŸ˜· Mr. Johnson: "Hey there, not great. Been dealing with a sore throat for a couple of days now. It's really scratchy and burns when I swallow. Taking some meds, but they only help a little. Had a fever this morning too. *coughs* Not feeling too good."
ðŸ©º Dr. Alex: how is the pain on a scale from 1 to
ðŸ˜· Mr. Johnson: "Oh, I'd say it's around a 7 or 8 out of 10. It's pretty uncomfortable and I can feel it even when I'm just talking. *pauses* Ugh, it even hurts when I swallow. Like, seriously hurts."
ðŸ©º Dr. Alex: dang I'm sorry that's really hard to hear
ðŸ˜· Mr. Johnson: "Thanks, man... *sighs* Yeah, it's been a real pain in the neck (no pun intended). I just want to feel better and go back to work. *glances down* But you know how it is with food preparation - gotta keep going even when you're not feeling your best."
