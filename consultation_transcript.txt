ðŸ©º Dr. Alex: hi Mr Johnson how are you

=== EPA Feedback ===

Rating: Adequate

Strengths:

1. Welcome greeting: Dr. Alex provided a warm and engaging greeting, acknowledging Mr. Johnson's presence and showing interest in his well-being. ("Hi Mr. Johnson, how are you?")
2. Expectation setting: Dr. Alex clearly explained the purpose of the consultation and what to expect during the examination, setting appropriate expectations for Mr. Johnson. ("Today we will be discussing your medical history and performing a physical examination.")

Areas for Improvement:

1. Questioning skills: Dr. Alex could improve their questioning skills by using more open-ended questions to encourage Mr. Johnson to share more information about his symptoms. ("Can you tell me more about the pain you've been experiencing?" instead of "How long have you been experiencing pain?")
2. Elicit patient perspective: Dr. Alex could do a better job of understanding and incorporating Mr. Johnson's viewpoint into their examination. They could ask follow-up questions to gather more information and clarify any misunderstandings. ("Can you tell me more about why you think this is happening?")

Action Plan:

1. Practice asking open-ended questions during subsequent consultations.
2. Make a conscious effort to truly listen to the patient's perspective and incorporate it into the examination.
3. Review the importance of empathy in medical communication and practice active listening skills.
